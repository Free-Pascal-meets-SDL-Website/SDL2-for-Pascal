# Tests for SDL2-for-Pascal Units

## Goal
These test cases are meant to ensure a basic quality of the
SDL2-for-Pascal units.

## Testing Framework
We use the [fptest](https://github.com/graemeg/fptest) testing framework to
perform the testing. We modified it slightly in that it allows for checking
of (classic) pointers. Also we applied a
[fix](https://github.com/graemeg/epiktimer/pull/4) to the
[EpikTimer](https://wiki.freepascal.org/EpikTimer) unit.

## Write a test
Just add a test case to *sdl2testcases.pas*.
